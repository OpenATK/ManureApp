# ManureApp

This repo contains the project files that make up the Manure App, a mobile app created to automatically create manure application records on a livestock operation. The app takes input data from the user to generate manure application records on a per load basis.
These files: platforms, www, config, hooks, and plugins make up the project folder when creating a Cordova app.
To download the Manure App for Android, download the ManureApp.APK file
